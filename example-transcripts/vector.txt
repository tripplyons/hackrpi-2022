So while everyone was losing their minds into strain colab instances using stable diffusion, open AI dropped a bombshell. They released Whisper. But what exactly is Whisper? Well, it's an ASR, or automatic speech recognition model for short. But Nick, haven't we gone and solved speech recognition already? You are spot on, but Whisper is unique and we'll touch on some of the uniqueness in a second. But for now, what you really need to know is that it is a single model and it is amazing. And it's amazing because it's able to translate and transcribe multiple languages from audio based speech ridiculously easily. I'm talking three lines of code. So let me give you the machine learning for one one. So while everyone was losing their minds into strain colab instances using stable diffusion, open AI dropped a bombshell. They released Whisper.
